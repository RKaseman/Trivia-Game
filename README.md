# Trivia-Game

I run out of time on the Thursday homework.

I disabled audio that should play for as long as the timer runs.

I have to figure out:
- how to change the images between option sets.
<!-- - why the first set of options doesn't show up. -->
<!-- - how to generate a single set of options and wipe out the old choices. -->
<!-- - how to advance the index of choices to the next set. -->
- answer right/wrong recognition.

- had the answer sets partially working, but I broke them again.
